    <p>Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, actor, producer, author,
      poet, and activist.[1] The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and
      commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized
      artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that
      developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has
      acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and
      the legalization of marijuana.</p>
    <p>Born during the Great Depression and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and
      joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer
      and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the air force but was later discharged due
      to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was
      succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in
      honky-tonks. Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, where he wrote "Family Bible" and recorded the song
      "Lumberjack" in 1956. He also worked as a disc jockey at various radio stations in Vancouver and nearby Portland
      Oregon.</p>
